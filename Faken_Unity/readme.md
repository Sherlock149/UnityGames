This is my own concept.
Faken is a fast paced 2 Player multiplayer game for Windows.
Players fight with each other to gain the top RED platform within 20 seconds. 
They can combat, dodge or even double jump in air.
Player standing on top of the RED platform when timer runs out, WINS.
*A fun game to play with friends (Don't break the keyboard tho !!)
