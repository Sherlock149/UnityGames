### unityGames
These are some of my games created in C# and unity.
There are 2 folders within each game folder :
1. Project : It contains all the project files, assets and scripts required to make the game. It can be directly opened using Unity Hub.
2. Game : It contains the final game after the build with a .exe file that can be opened in Windows (the version gets updated if I make changes).
The C# scripts are created in Visual Studio 2019. 
Unity version: 2019.4.14f1
*Anyone can contribute to modify and improve the games.*
